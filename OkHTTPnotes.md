### Markdown file that contains all my notes on OkHTTP. 

**Motivation:** on the tutorials that I'm following to do this mobile application, one of the authors mentioned this project to HTTP client for Android. Having said so, I decided to study more about it. I have little experience with HTTP protocols and thus decided to learn more about it. I always like to develop study guides with GitBook after I finish learning something, this project will be no different. 

**About the project:** OkHTTP is an API to use HTTP in java/android applications networking. 

The official website is: http://square.github.io/okhttp/

This is also an open source project and the developersaccept contributions! Fork the repo in: https://github.com/square/okhttp
